## 1.0.0 - 9/15/2020

### BREAKING CHANGES

All options now have a slightly different shape and include a label. This label is intented to provide more information on how the options are intended to be used and also solves the problem of trying to have a one of option. To access the same information, use the `items` key inside of each `ages`, `symptoms`, `conditions`, etc.

#### Previously

```
export const ages: ScorableCollection<Age> = [
  { prompt: '0-17', key: '0-17', preExisting: 0 },
  { prompt: '18-39', key: '18-39', preExisting: 0 },
  { prompt: '40-64', key: '40-64', preExisting: 0 },
  { prompt: '65-69', key: '65-69', preExisting: 10 },
  { prompt: '70-79', key: '70-79', preExisting: 15 },
  { prompt: '80+', key: '80-Infinity', preExisting: 20 },
];
```

#### Now

```
export const ages: ScorableCollection<Age> = {
  key: 'ages',
  label: "What's your age (in years)?",
  items: [
    { prompt: '0-17', key: '0-17', preExisting: 0 },
    { prompt: '18-39', key: '18-39', preExisting: 0 },
    { prompt: '40-64', key: '40-64', preExisting: 0 },
    { prompt: '65-69', key: '65-69', preExisting: 10 },
    { prompt: '70-79', key: '70-79', preExisting: 15 },
    { prompt: '80+', key: '80-Infinity', preExisting: 20 },
  ],
};
```

- cough 10 -> 20

## 0.3.1 - 6/30/2020

Both of these will allow for better tracking of data collected based on what version (both package and calculator) is in use.

- `packageVersion` at the top level indicates the current package version

## 0.3.0 - 6/2/2020

### Fixed

- Typo `PreExsitingCondition` -> `PreExistingCondition` ðŸ¤¦

## 0.2.0 - 6/1/2020

### Fixed

- `calculateScores` now includes `ages`
- `calculateLevel` now uses a level's value as an includive lower bound. Ex. `['low', 10]` means that a `score = 10` is labeled as `low` where previously it would have been labeled as `veryLow`.
- `calculateScore` api has been updated in all calculator versions prior to calculator version `v1.4.0`
