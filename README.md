# COVID-19 Calculator

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40deptofdefense%2Fcovid19-calculator.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40deptofdefense%2Fcovid19-calculator)

## Description

COVID-19 Calculator provides a set of scoring algorithms for evaluating COVID-19 symptoms implemented in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). The algorithms and associated inputs in this model are based on United States Department of Defense medical opinion and are actively used in [MySymptoms.mil](https://mysymptoms.mil/).

This calculator is currently maintained by [Defense Digital Service](https://dds.mil/) (DDS).

## Usage

### Installation

NPM:

```
npm install @deptofdefense/covid19-calculator
```

Yarn:

```
yarn add @deptofdefense/covid19-calculator
```

### Latest Calculator

Importing from the base will import the latest version.

ES6:

```TSX
import { ages, conditions, symptoms, /*...*/ calculate } from '@deptofdefense/covid19-calculator'
```

CommonJS:

```TSX
const { ages, conditions, symptoms, /*...*/ calculate } = require('@deptofdefense/covid19-calculator')
```

### Previous Calculator

If you are interested in importing a previous version simply append the version. Each version functions as an independent package and thus the exports and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) types may be different between versions.

ES6:

```TSX
import { v1_3_0 } from '@deptofdefense/covid19-calculator'
const { ages, conditions, symptoms, /*...*/ calculate } = v1_3_0
```

CommonJS:

```TSX
const { v1_3_0 } = require('@deptofdefense/covid19-calculator')
const { ages, conditions, symptoms, /*...*/ calculate } = v1_3_0

```

### API

The following functions are exported. A category is a string in the exported list `categories`, i.e., `likelihood`, `exposure`, or `preExisting`. A score is an integer `[0, N)` with the maximum number changing depending on the model version. A level is a human-readable string the indicates the magnitude of the score, e.g., `low`, `medium`, or `high`.

NOTE: At this time, consider this api in "beta" with the possibility of changing slightly in future releases.

```TSX
import { calculate, calculateScores, calculateLevel, calculateLevels } from '@deptofdefense/covid19-calculator'
// calculate returns the integer scores and string levels
const { scores, levels } = calculate({ ... })
// calculateScores just returns the integer scores
const { likelihoodScore, exposureScore, preExistingScore } = calculateScores({
  symptoms: [...],
  conditions: [...]
})
// calculateLevels returns the string levels for the given scores
const { likelihoodLevel, exposureLevel, preExistingLevel } = calculateLevels({
  likelihoodScore,
  exposureScore,
  preExistingScore
})
// calculateLevel returns the string level for the given score
const { likelihoodLevel } = calculateLevel('likelihood', 30)
```

If you need to correlate incoming data with calculator parameters, consider using a hashing algorithm to resolve parameters. See the [advanced example](examples/advanced.js) for more info.

## Examples

For the full list of examples see the [examples](examples) folder.

### Simple Example

```TSX
const { calculate } = require('@deptofdefense/covid19-calculator');

const result = calculate({
  symptoms: ['fever', 'lossOfSmell'],
  conditions: ['hardBreathing'],
});
/*
 * result
 * {
 *   scores: { likelihood: 20, exposure: 0, preExisting: 0 },
 *   levels: { likelihood: 'low', exposure: 'low', preExisting: 'low' }
 * }
 */
```

## Local Development

This project was bootstrapped with [TSDX](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/tsdx). Below is a list of commands you will probably find useful.

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the project in development/watch mode. Your project will be rebuilt upon changes. TSDX has a special logger for you convenience. Error messages are pretty printed and formatted for compatibility VS Code's Problems tab. Your library will be rebuilt if you make edits.

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Bundles the package to the `dist` folder. The package is optimized and bundled with Rollup into multiple formats (CommonJS, UMD, and ES Module).

### `npm test` or `yarn test`

Runs the test watcher (Jest) in an interactive mode. By default, runs tests related to files changed since the last commit.
